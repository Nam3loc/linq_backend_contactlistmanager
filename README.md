# Contact List Manager

## Time Spent

2 hours

## Description

I built a simple contact list manager app where you can create, view, update, and delete contacts. I added a search functionality with some simple edge case logic to ensure a smooth experience.

## Technologies Used

- Ruby  
- Ruby on Rails


## Instructions

To run this Ruby on Rails application locally, follow these steps:

- Ensure you have Ruby and Rails installed - If you need instructions, here is a walkthrough: Ensure you have Ruby and Rails installed — if you need instructions, [check out this walkthrough](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/install_ruby_on_rails.html).

- Clone the repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Nam3loc/linq_softwareengineer_project.git
  ```
- Navigate into the project directory:  
  ```bash
  cd contact-list-manager
  ```
- Install the necessary gems:  
  ```bash
  bundle install
  ```
- Set up the database:  
  ```bash
  rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
  ```
- Start the Rails server:  
  ```bash
  bin/rails server
  ```
- Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to use the application.

## Trade Offs

I debated using Rails vs Node when deciding how to start this application. While I’ve never fully built with Rails before, I’ve been learning Ruby through courses and experimenting with Rails on the side. On the other hand, Node often requires a lot of setup and configuration, which I felt would cut into my actual building time. I decided to give Rails a shot—and it turned out to be an amazing learning experience.

That said, there were some trade offs. Since I was learning as I went, I spent more time understanding the Rails framework and less time styling the application or writing unit tests like I had planned. I also did not have time to create a React frontend like I planned. Still, I’m proud of what I was able to build and learn in just about two hours.

## Future Implementations

With more time, I would add styling to the project to improve the user experience. I would also create unit testing to ensure functionality works as the app expands. I would also add more data that you could add to the contact, such as phone number, address, date of birth, notes, and the ability to favorite a contact.
